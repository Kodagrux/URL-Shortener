## URL-shortener for arbr.se (deprecated)
This was originally just made as a school project (in a cource about databases) but later turned into a product I used on the domain http://www.arbr.se (deprecated). It is a DIY URL-shortener built in PHP using Laravel and open for everyone to use. Detailed instructions on how to set it up and how use it might come later.
